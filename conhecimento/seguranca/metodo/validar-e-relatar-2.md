#### `REPORT.md`

Write:

1. Run profile, scope, budget (if set) with agents spent versus planned, source ref, sandboxed source-and-local-only execution statement, prior-run use, and explicit deferred and out-of-scope coverage. Name carried same-source confirmations and changed-source revalidations. A `quick`, scoped, budget-limited, or incomplete run states plainly that it is a partial pass. If candidate validation exhausted a strict budget, state that the run is incomplete and list every unvalidated fingerprint and linked unit; do not describe those candidates as findings. If the budget prevented a mandatory critic, state which critic did not run and make no clean-coverage claim.
2. One short security posture summary.
3. A confirmed-findings table: severity, title, affected boundary, and one-line observed result.
4. Each confirmed finding: repository source location, lower-trust principal, target-native bounded reproduction, conditions, actual result, impact, priority rationale, and smallest source fix.
5. A separate `NEEDS VALIDATION` table. Give each lead's title, repository trace, exact blocker, bounded local next step, and safe owner-observed deployment check. Do not assign severity or call it a confirmed vulnerability.
6. Separate hardening notes and positive source patterns.
7. Coverage summary from the ledger: covered, candidate, blocked, and deferred counts, plus important exclusions and the final critic result.

Do not describe rejected records as findings. Mention their fingerprints only when they explain a prior disagreement or coverage decision.

#### `FINDINGS-DETAIL.md`

For each confirmed `medium`, `high`, or `critical` record, copy the complete source path and target-neutral local reproduction:

- ordered repository-relative trace and evidence;
- dummy attacker/principal and affected dummy resource;
- native input, invocation, or fixture and exact bounded instructions;
- observed output and the security invariant it proves;
- conditions and containment;
- source-level remediation and regression case.

#### `NEEDS-VALIDATION.md`

For every unresolved record, copy the source trace, verified evidence, exact blocker, affected boundary, and each applicable bounded local or owner-observed resolution plan. Keep these as prioritized leads without severity. Do not turn them into live test guidance or assume the missing deployment fact.

HTTP is one possible native interface, not the default. A library finding may use a function call, a parser a fixture, a CLI a command, a desktop app an IPC or file action, and infrastructure a locally rendered policy. Do not require an endpoint, external account, or live environment that the target does not have.

Keep the report proportional to the evidence. A clean run may have zero confirmed records. State that result and the remaining coverage/validation limits without inventing LOW findings.
