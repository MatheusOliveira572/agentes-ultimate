## Structured hunter result

Return exactly one JSON object, with no surrounding prose:

```json
{
  "units": [
    {
      "coverage_id": "one assigned ID",
      "disposition": "covered|candidate|blocked",
      "reviewed_paths": ["repo/relative/path"],
      "checks": [
        {
          "agent_id": "canonical owner of this check",
          "reviewed_paths": ["repo/relative/path owned by this check"],
          "invariant": "specific control checked for this unit",
          "method": "source|local",
          "result": "what source or the bounded check established",
          "artifact": "agents/<agent-id>/artifacts/file for local, null for source"
        }
      ],
      "candidate_fingerprints": [],
      "unresolved": []
    }
  ],
  "candidates": [],
  "hardening": ["concrete non-finding note"],
  "uncovered": [
    {
      "surface": "...",
      "boundary": "...",
      "subsystem": "...",
      "attack_class": "...",
      "starting_paths": ["repo/relative/path"],
      "reason": "why this needs its own deterministic coverage unit"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each `candidates` entry is schema-shaped except that it uses `proposed_verdict` in place of `verdict`:

- `proposed_verdict: "confirmed"`: include every field required by the `confirmed` branch of `report-schema.json` other than `verdict`: `fingerprint`, title, description, `root_cause`, `intended_behavior`, ordered `trace`, `evidence`, `conditions`, target-neutral `execution`, `remediation`, `severity`, and `confidence`. The execution instructions describe only the bounded local check already performed. `payloads` holds the minimum test input, fixture, or native invocation. `observed_result` records actual local output. Overall severity must not exceed observed impact.
- `proposed_verdict: "needs_validation"`: include every field required by that schema branch other than `verdict`: `fingerprint`, title, description, `claimed_root_cause`, ordered `trace`, `evidence`, nonempty `blockers`, and `validation_plan` with at least one applicable `local` or `deployment` step. Do not invent an inapplicable context. Do not include severity, execution, remediation, reason, or a confirmed `root_cause`. `deployment` is an owner-observed check, not a request to probe a live target.

Every assigned coverage ID appears exactly once in `units`. A `covered` unit needs an owner, nonempty `reviewed_paths` and `checks`, no unresolved fact, and no candidate. A `candidate` unit has the same owned evidence and is the only state that carries linked fingerprints. A `blocked` unit is an owned partial review with nonempty paths, checks, and unresolved facts but no fingerprint. All source paths are repository-relative, never absolute or traversal paths. A trace with several entries begins at `entrypoint`, ends at `sink`, and labels intermediate steps `propagation`. Every check has its own canonical lowercase `agent_id` and nonempty `reviewed_paths`; the unit-level list is exactly the union of those owned paths. A `source` check uses `artifact: null`. A `local` check uses one successfully parent-promoted regular file beneath `agents/<check.agent_id>/artifacts/`; this permits a verifier to add independently owned evidence without taking ownership from the hunter. Never link scratch, an output-root file, or another check owner's artifact.

## Parent consolidation and ledger update

The parent validates each unit result, maps it to exactly one assigned `coverage_id`, and updates only that ledger unit. Reject duplicate or absent IDs, unsafe unit or check agent IDs, source checks with artifacts, and local artifacts that trusted parent-side code did not promote into the check owner's artifacts subtree. Copy the unit's `reviewed_paths`, its `checks` into the unit's `local_checks`, linked artifact paths, candidate fingerprints, and unresolved facts into the ledger. Retain each hunter's `hardening` list in a parent bookkeeping field on the relevant units (outside the semantic fields) so Phase 6 can report it. A failed, malformed, or unsupported conclusion leaves that unit `planned` for reassignment. Untouched budget/profile units become unassigned `deferred` units with empty evidence and a reason; do not hide partial evidence in `deferred`. Run `validate-coverage-ledger.cjs` after the update; an invalid ledger cannot drive another assignment. This per-unit contract allows one hunter to close one unit while returning a candidate or blocker for another.

Consolidate candidate entries by fingerprint and then by root cause. One root cause that exposes several entry paths or effects is one candidate with the strongest complete trace. Related but independent missing controls use separate fingerprints. Record duplicate fingerprints in the relevant ledger unit and do not send duplicate candidates to validation.

## Coverage-critic waves

Immediately after each hunter wave, spend the reserved invocation on one fresh `research` post-wave coverage critic. It receives `architecture.md`, the full coverage ledger including each assignment block map, current candidate fingerprints and states, and the prior-ledger gap summary. It reads source but does not write or run targets. Require exactly this JSON:

```json
{
  "missing_units": [
    {
      "surface": "...",
      "boundary": "...",
      "subsystem": "...",
      "attack_class": "...",
      "starting_paths": ["repo/relative/path"],
      "selected_companion_blocks": ["FILE.md#section"],
      "excluded_blocks": [{"block": "FILE.md#section", "reason": "..."}],
      "reason": "source-backed coverage gap"
    }
  ],
  "reassign_ids": ["existing-id-that-did-not-close"],
  "resolved_prior_leads": ["fingerprint"],
  "stop": false
}
```

The critic checks for unmapped entry points, unchecked parallel paths, missing lifecycle modes, selected companion classes without a unit, unjustified exclusions, units closed without paths/checks, and prior `needs_validation` or changed-source gaps that no unit addresses. It proposes coverage, not findings. `stop` is the critic's own assessment: `true` only when it accepts no `missing_units` and no `reassign_ids`; the parent's loop condition below, not `stop` alone, decides whether another wave runs. For each fingerprint in `resolved_prior_leads`, the parent marks the linked unit or prior-lead entry resolved and records the critic's source-backed reason.

The parent rejects proposed units outside the review scope or source/local boundary, derives canonical IDs for accepted units, and deduplicates them against current units. A prior same-source completed unit may supply evidence; prior `deferred`, `blocked`, `out_of_scope`, or changed-source units become current work and never suppress an accepted unit. Fail rather than merge a canonical ID collision. For each legitimate `reassign_id` with live `blocked`, `covered`, or `candidate` evidence, append that exact terminal record to the unit's `attempts` with the critic's source-backed `reassignment_reason`. Preserve its owner, checks, artifacts, fingerprints, and unresolved facts in that archive. Increment the live `wave`; the next hunter must be a fresh owner and receives an `in_progress` unit with empty live evidence. The hunter's terminal result writes only its new evidence into the live fields. Never copy an archived owner's checks or artifacts into the new live attempt. Sort IDs and validate the ledger before another assignment. In `standard` and `deep`, when the post-wave critic reports no accepted `missing_units` or legitimate `reassign_ids` and no `planned` units remain, spend the separately reserved invocation on a distinct final-clean critic. Complete coverage only when that critic also returns no accepted work. If it finds work, queue it and repeat the wave, post-wave critic, and final-clean process. If time or resources force an early stop, mark every untouched unit `deferred`, preserve the critic's reason, and disclose the gap in the report. Never use a silent wave or agent cap as evidence of complete coverage.

The run profile bounds this loop. A `quick` run has exactly one hunter wave followed by exactly one final critic pass. Add each accepted `missing_unit` to the current ledger and mark it `deferred` with reason `quick_profile_final_critic`. For each legitimate evidence-bearing `reassign_id`, archive the live terminal state in `attempts`, increment `wave`, and set the live state to unassigned `deferred` with empty evidence and reason `quick_profile_final_critic`. Do not launch a second hunter wave or another critic. In a scoped run, the critic still reports out-of-scope gaps it notices, but the parent records them as `out_of_scope` with the critic's reason instead of assigning them. The early-stop rule above is the same mechanism: `quick` is a pre-declared early stop, not evidence of complete coverage.

A budget bounds it the same way. Before assigning each wave, compare remaining budget against its hunter count, the validation reserve, the immediate post-wave critic, and the retained final-clean critic (`quick` reserves only its single final post-wave critic). Shrink the hunter wave to fit, taking units in priority order. If those mandatory reserves do not fit, launch no hunter from that wave and mark its planned units `deferred` with reason `budget_cannot_reserve_critics_and_validation`. Critic-proposed units enter the same ranked queue rather than extending the budget. If surviving candidates exceed the validation reserve, follow the incomplete-run rule in `SKILL.md`: stop hunting, validate in fingerprint order, retain unvalidated units as unresolved candidates, and never present them as findings.
