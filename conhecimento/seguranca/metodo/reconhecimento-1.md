# Reconnaissance

### Phase 1: Map the source and plan coverage

The parent initializes `run-metadata.json`, applies the strict pre-reconnaissance budget gate in `SKILL.md`, then creates agent scratch roots and the shared ledger before hunting. If the gate fails, record the incomplete status in metadata and launch no reconnaissance agent. Reconnaissance reads the target and locally available build/configuration state only. It does not contact deployed endpoints, external identity providers, registries, brokers, cloud APIs, or other shared services.

Launch several `research` agents in parallel. They return structured facts to the parent and do not write files.

**Agent 1a: Product, stack, and local operation**

```text
Read the target at <target>. Do not use network access. Return:
1. Product type, users, operators, and ordinary trust-sensitive actions.
2. Languages, frameworks, build system, runtimes, and locally visible deployment models.
3. Repository-relative entry points and subsystem boundaries.
4. Exact build and test commands that could run offline with local dependencies, their expected write locations, and the target-controlled inputs they process. Do not run them during reconnaissance.
5. Comparable software or protocol visible from local documentation and dependencies. If no useful comparison is source-grounded, say so.
6. Missing local toolchains or runtime facts that limit bounded execution.
Return only source facts with repository-relative file:line references.
```

**Agent 1b: Principals, authority, and controls**

```text
Read all source that establishes identity, authorization, isolation, and privilege. Map:
1. Each lower-trust principal and the actions it has by design.
2. Authentication or peer identity at each entry surface.
3. Per-resource authorization and tenant/owner scope.
4. Process, browser, workload, CI, plugin, model/tool, device, or local-IPC authority.
5. Privilege changes, confirmation, revocation, recovery, and fallback paths.
6. Which controls are source-visible and which depend on an unobserved deployment fact.
Return trust boundaries and control locations with repository-relative file:line references. Do not infer live reachability.
```

**Agent 1c: Entry surfaces, copies, and sinks**

```text
Inventory every source-visible place external or lower-trust input enters:
- HTTP/browser, RPC/message/protocol, files/archive/document, CLI/env/config, plugins/dependencies/CI, cloud events/IAM selectors, model context/tool arguments, mobile/deep-link/webview, and local IPC.
For each surface, follow major transformations, stored or derived copies, and security-relevant sinks. Record source-visible limits and parallel paths to the same effect.
Return repository-relative paths and line numbers. Be complete, but do not execute or send inputs.
```

**Agent 1d: Local execution and deployment visibility**

```text
Read tests, build definitions, manifests, packaging, and maintained environment overlays. Return:
1. Small offline tests or existing fixtures that could validate trust boundaries with dummy data inside the required OS-enforced sandbox.
2. Processes that could use an isolated loopback network namespace without external or shared dependencies.
3. Commands that would fetch dependencies, publish artifacts, contact paid/provider APIs, or affect shared state; mark them prohibited for this run.
4. Deployed controls and attachments that source cannot establish and therefore require needs_validation if decisive.
5. The final active source path for each deployment mode only where the repository selects it deterministically.
6. Whether the local platform can enforce an empty allowlisted environment, no external network, read-only target/toolchain mounts, scratch-only writes, and explicit CPU, memory, process, file-size, disk, and wall-clock limits. Missing controls block target-controlled execution.
7. Whether trusted parent-side code can promote predeclared scratch files with path-confined no-follow descriptor traversal, nonblocking regular-file checks, no-follow traversal of every destination parent, exclusive regular-file destination creation, and explicit per-file and cumulative size bounds. Missing promotion controls block use of scratch files as evidence.
```

Add focused reconnaissance agents for materially distinct deployment modes or subsystems that these four do not map. Do not silently omit them: if the budget gate in `SKILL.md` blocks a focused agent, launch nothing for it, seed the unmapped area as a `deferred` ledger unit with reason `budget_cannot_reserve_critics_and_validation`, and disclose the gap in the report.

## Prior-run input

Before selecting work, the parent reads every available prior `coverage-ledger.json` and `findings.json` for the same repo:

- Compare the source locations, controls, conditions, and source-derived identity for every prior record and unit against the current source.
- Carry an unchanged prior `confirmed` record into the current candidate set, with the same fingerprint, only when its relevant source, conditions, and qualifying evidence still apply. Link it to a current `planned` unit with `prior_status: "prior_confirmed_same_source"` and put only that root cause on the hunter exclusion list. The Phase 3 verifier that re-verifies the carried record becomes that unit's assignment owner; its source re-check is the unit's first check and moves the unit to `candidate` with the carried fingerprint.
- Build a current planned `prior_confirmed_changed_source` revalidation unit when any relevant source or condition changed. Do not exclude that root cause from hunting or assume the prior verdict still applies.
- Build current work units for every prior `needs_validation`, `deferred`, `blocked`, `out_of_scope`, and changed-source unit. These states are priority input, never deduplication or suppression keys.
- Carry a still-blocked prior `needs_validation` record with the same fingerprint only after current source supports its trace. Link it to a current `planned` unit with `prior_status: "prior_needs_validation"`; the record keeps the unresolved blocker. The Phase 3 verifier that re-checks the carried record becomes that unit's assignment owner; its re-check is the unit's first check and moves the unit to `candidate` with the carried fingerprint. Include the record in final verification.
- Treat prior rejected records as stale claims unless current evidence changes the failed trace or missing condition. An unchanged rejection suppresses only that exact claim, not review of the coverage unit.
- Record missing or incompatible ledgers instead of treating them as empty coverage.

State paths and source refs used in `run-metadata.json`. Summarize only the coverage consequences in `architecture.md`.

## Architecture summary and companion selection

The parent synthesizes `<output-dir>/architecture.md`, with a hard cap of about 1,000 words. Include:

1. Product, principals, normal authority, and protected resources.
2. The comparable-software baseline from Agent 1a, when one is source-grounded: what security trade-offs the comparable accepts. Use it to calibrate effort and severity, never to dismiss a demonstrated finding; if the comparable shares a defect pattern that has mattered in practice, that strengthens the finding. Omit this line when no meaningful comparable exists.
3. Tech stack, source-visible deployment paths, and offline build/test limits.
4. Entry surfaces and the important source-to-sink or lifecycle paths.
5. Trust boundaries and the strongest source-visible control on each.
6. Repository-relative starting paths.
7. Prior coverage gaps, changed-source and blocked revalidation targets, and same-source confirmed exclusions.
8. A short companion-selection summary derived from [ATTACK-CLASSES.md](../classes-de-ataque-1.md): selected files and the source-visible boundaries that require them.

Keep the assignment-level ordinary block, selected companion blocks, and excluded blocks with reasons in each ledger unit, not in `architecture.md`. This keeps the architecture cap valid for large runs and makes the exact hunter prompt map machine-checkable.

Do not select a companion file merely because the language or dependency name appears. Select it because reconnaissance found the trust-sensitive boundary described by its `When to use this file` section. Do not exclude a visible boundary just because another agent will review a related class.
